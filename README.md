# Data-Visualization-overview
The field of data visualization combines the art of graphic design with the science of data analytics. 
I used R and Tableau to create effective visualizations that clearly and efficiently communicate relationships within data, and learned how to perform exploratory analysis through visualization, how to create professional looking visualizations for use in business reports and presentations, and how to design interactive visualizations and dashboards. 

## Data-Visualization-ggplot2
I used ggplot2 package in R to create effective visualizations. In this example, I answered "Which airlineâ€™s flights delayed the most and why?" via three charts created by ggplot2.
